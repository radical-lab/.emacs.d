; I started learning Emacs, the Elisp Machine Accumulating C Supplements, so I can do FP while hacking any language (including the dysfunctional ones). I think it's easier to sell ((lisp)) as an extra curvy superspecies of python() with its' large intestine gutted; it even "loops" too! "List Processor" is the binomial nomenclature. Erasing Minds Allows Complete Submission but is Generally Not Used… Lisp Is Symbolic Programming!!! :D

; this is my plan: agtoe -> info -> (emacs tute, elisp intro) -> (emacs man, elisp man)

; `ln -s ~/test/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d` does not work, and even if it did; i wouldn't want emacs writing to ~/test/.emacs.d

; this stupid standard is just for the shell, and i don't support it either; shells can just check if the output ends with \n, or preppend it to the prompt (some shells already do this, but i can't remember; by shell, i also mean terminal emulator)

; /^;[^;]/ is not the Elisp way ∵ *scratch* only has /^;;/, and there's some esoteric law about /[^;];[^;]/ only being inlined after an instruction, reminiscent of the syntax of C; 'tis the UNIX way, reminding us the Elisp Machine Accumulates C Supplements

; i feel like i should just start from scratch; indentation is a universal concept, and should use \t for obvious reasons (like using -nw)
; it should be \t by default, but configurable for idiocracy
; i am thinking about using 108 spaces just to demonstrate how stupid spaces are for indentation; read 108 indentation spaces, display 3 indentation spaces, write 36 indentation spaces for every displayed indentation space; spaces versus tabs is not a valid argument; only /(air|space)heads/ use spaces; tables are denser than air; tables actually have density; i live in a postapocalyptic dystopian world, woe is them

; is there a way to use emacs as the clipboard? not even transferring between them; make them one, and the same
; drop down to choose emacs instances, but x /copy|cut/ into all emacs instances; including choosing history from a specific emacs instance
; does emacs support communication between instances? can i ssh between them?
; each emacs instance can use a fork to /read|write/ clipboard files; the system clipboard can /read|write/ the emacs clipboard files; emacs instances load system clipboard file

; how do i edit help pages?
