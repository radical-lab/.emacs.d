INFO: AN INTRODUCTION

h  ; programmed instruction sequence
nn ; advanced info commands, skipping over the getting started chapter
?  ; summary of all available commands in emacs
H  ; summary of all available commands in info

GETTING STARTED: GETTING STARTED

; linear sequence
[  ; skip   up
\b ; scroll up
 b ; beginning (goto Top; do not $croll back to the future)
\s ; scroll down
]  ; skip   down

; branching structure
n ; next a node
p ; prev a node
u ; up   a node

C-l ; redraw
C-L ; redraw

? ; help
H ; help (split screens)

; 1.4: Terminal dimensions are known ∴ you can warn users about large nodes ∵ no"-thing" is impossible!

M-x visible-mode ; toggle invisible ink
(setq Info-hide-note-references nil) ; no invisible ink

m "name a node" ; iff there is a menu of hyperlinked nodes     (au\tocomple\te is at your friendly disposal, or C-g)
f "name a node" ; iff there are hyperlinked cross references   (au\tocomple\te is at your friendly disposal, or C-g)
i "name a node" ; iff there are hyperlinked indices #tautology (au\tocomple\te is at your friendly disposal, or C-g)
m ? ; m \t      ; list menu
f ? ; f \t      ; list cross references
i ? ; i \t      ; list indices of the index node
/((S-)?\t)*\r/  ; bidirectionally cycle through menus, and cross references, then goto the hyperlinked node
M-\t            ; WINDOW MANAGER TABBING BETWEEN WINDOW FRAMES

l ; return from logged hyperlinking (hyperspacial \escape velocity) (they use hyperlogging for human subject research) (l is for last)
r ; Info-history-forward (r is for revisit hyperlogs)
L ; Info-history (goto hyperlog node)
d ; Info-directory (goto directory node)
t ; Info-top-node (goto top node)
; directory node -> top node

q ; Info-exit (q is for quit but means \escape)

ADVANCED INFO COMMANDS

/C-q \??/ ; INFO IS READ ONLY, SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS (MAYBE IT IS JUST TOO ADVANCED, SO EARLY ON, FOR MY BELITTLED BRAIN #NEUROPLASTICITY)
