"The ‘G’ in GNU (GNU’s Not Unix) is not silent." ; like Knuth(Ka-NOOTH.), TeX(τέχ), /Linu(s|x)/(https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/SillySounds/), gif(Jif; Choosy developers choose GIF), cache(cash; like stash, but french), Haskell(Has Kell?), Shyam(Śyāma),..

"Most of the editing commands in Emacs are written in Lisp; the few exceptions could have been written in Lisp but use C instead for efficiency." ; Elisp Machine Accumulating C Supplements
