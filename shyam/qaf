% who the hell uses this? i feel so handicapped
% meat eaters must use \s for indentation ∵ i don't understand these "people" (zombies); they lack the intellectual capacity to recognise the superiority of \t for indentation

emacs cut, and copy, region? i will just paste it back instead of learning copy region, since C-k is more useful than C-a C-k (vims' double ds)
