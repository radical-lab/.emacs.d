serious(programming) :- fix(indentation). % emacs from scratch would be better, but i don't want to do it more than once
% EMACS defaults are Generally Not Used
% not being able to /\t|indent/ in certain files is just crippling; most especially in multiple line comments, where it stoning matters
% who the hell uses this? i feel so handicapped
% meat eaters must use \s for indentation ∵ i don't understand these "people" (zombies); they lack the intellectual capacity to recognise the superiority of \t for indentation

emacs cut, and copy, region? i will just paste it back instead of learning copy region, since C-k is more useful than C-a C-k (vims' double ds)

/F3 .* F4 (F4)*/ ; macros (vim supports more, but not that much more) this is what you do for all actions; sandwich them between macros (kind of like vim \e in terms of frequency, but for vim \.) it's just bound to inconvenient keys for some"-thing" that's so fundamentally useful; unless there's another way?

i agree that elisp is better than macros, and it's probably for the best that macros are inconvenient; what i need is `M-: ( C-a )` = `M-: ( move-beginning-of-line )`; or just use au\tocomple\tion

C-x C-s ; save
C-x C-c ; escape
C-g ; vim \e

/C-(a|e)/ ; /(s|e)ol/
/M-(<|>)  ; /(s|e)of/
/(C|M)-v/ ; page /up|down/ …do i really actually use this?

C-e C-k \s C-b ; vim S-j

TODO
	goto loc (makes /M-(<|>)/ redundant)
		draw relative loc# (absolute loc y is in the mode line, but need char x)
		goto relative loc# to make s/b(np)f/\1/ redundant
	r-expressions
	buffers; need to script multiple file access on boot, or even restore session on boot, well kind of both, but make it an editable file c̄ either /first|last/ the default, or even tiling… hack `C-x b` to prompt saving first, universal argument can be promptless; or some"-thing"
	that server "-thing" to replace terminal tabbing
	maybe narrowing

		C-x n w ; zoom out region
	probably not mark (for a recurse anyway)
		C-x C-x ; swap mark, and /cursor|point/
		/C-\s/  ; set mark at /cursor|point/, and /select|highlight/ /selection|region/ …i might use this every now and then, but probably not ∵ /(C-)?(S-)?(←|↓|↑|→)/
