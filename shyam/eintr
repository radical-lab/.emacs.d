LISP HISTORY: LISP HISTORY
Lisp was first developed in the late 1950s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for research in artificial intelligence.
The great power of the Lisp language makes it superior for other purposes as well, such as writing editor commands and integrated environments.
(The standard Emacs distribution contains an optional extensions file, `cl.el`, that adds many Common Lisp features to Emacs Lisp.)
