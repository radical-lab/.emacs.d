## Computational Communication
gui ⊃ {emacs, browser, terminal}
* terminal versus browser
	* browser ⊃ {www, file system, txt, pdf, img, snd, vid, games, terminal}
	* terminal ⊃ {cmd, file system, txt, img, snd, vid, games, browser}
### Microphone (Voice Recognition)
* turing machine macros
	* recursion = feedback loop from speakers
* (lojban) natural language
	* !xhosa clicks = mouse clicks
	* chinese tones = mouse scrolling
	* chinese tones = magnification zooming
### WWW Camera (Fingerprint Reader)
* cover gestures
	* thumbed touch = lock screen (toggle)
	* thumbed hold = `kill -9 *; cat eyes` (toggle)
	* indexed touch = `sudo $next`
	* indexed hold = sudomode (toggle)
* (great ape) sign language
	* thumbs up = yes
	* thumbs down = no
	* middle finger = `-n`
	* vulcan salute = `-y`
	* secret hitler salute c̄ finger moustache = `rm -fr / # french self-destruct willn't recursively descend into /dev/sd$x`
* facial gestures
	* bare teeth = `perl -e 'make it so or die'`; allocate all resources to `$task` until it is done
	* bare teeth = `kill -9 $task`
	* bare teeth = just undo `/freeze|crash|hang|kernel panic|.*/`!!! `D=8<`
	* bare teeth = reisub
### Keyboard Driven Environment (EMACS)
* 40≤n-key rollover keyboard
	* wasd versus esdf
		* wasd is easier on emacs pinky
		* esdf is home sweet home
* n-key rollover keyboard
	* face plant = undo
	* head banging = multiple undo
	* head banging = play music
### Touch Screen (Tiling Window Manager)
* zooming
* scrolling
* `/sw(i|ap)ping/`
* border patrol
* microsoft product activation
* gourmet menu
* mousing
### Touch Pad (Mouse)
* gaming
### The Future
* `/motorcycle|space/` helmet
	* bci; neurological exoskellington (intelligence amplification, augmented learning)
	* cameras (input = photon particles)
		* depth perception
	* microphones (input = sound waves)
		* echolocation sonar (external)
		* binaural voice recording (internal)
	* speakers (output = sound waves)
		* bone conduction
		* headphones
	* visor `/(v|a)r/` (output = photon particles)
	* pure O₂ c̄out any polluting contaminants (microplastics)
	* the outside of the helmet will feature tridimensional james bond invisibility technology for multinterface (sic erat scriptum) allowing for multiple private conversations in person
		* project head to multiple perspectives (external)
		* project conversations from multiple perspectives (internal)
		* directional speakers for binaural recording (external); the right (interference) pattern(s)'ll support lightsaber renderings by crossing the streams
		* directional sound from microphones (internal)
* gloves, or even a full body suit (polygraph, exoskellington)
	* wetsuit versus drysuit versus spacesuit
	* super heroic lycra to the rescue!!! :D
* faraday cage to protect from neurodegenerative cosmic rays and carcinogenic radi(ation)o waves
	* all `/wifi|transmitters|transceivers|receivers|.*/` will be external
	* `/photonic|audio|.*/` wireless technology is preferential
* `/charging|refueling|.*/`
	* O₂ (probably use `/algae|.*/` for portability)
	* e⁻ (probably use `/bio(electromagnetical|thermal|neural|spiritual|.*)|.*/` for portability)
	* H₂O (probably use recycled drinking water from `/human waste|perspiration|spit|vomit|snot|.*/` for portability)

## Hmm
* Saints Row is Home Sweet Home!
	* Query:
		* I have started learning Emacs, and have just completed `C-h t`, where the conclusion says to complain, but not how, nor who ∴ I complain to you; what is the correct way to type in Emacs? Left `C-` can only be pinkied. Right `C-` could either be pinkied, ringed, or thumbed. Left, and right, `M-` could either be middled, indexed, or thumbed. I am assuming you type `C-`, and `M-`, on the opposite side of the keyboard from the following key, using both hands; but it may be more productively efficient to use one hand for one hand touch typing, thus enabling the multitasking of two computers, concurrently.
		* Going from Vim to Emacs is like WTF is with bnpf? They are all over the place! (Compared against hjkl in Vim; f is all the way on the other side of the keyboard!).
	* [Answer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_computer_science).
* I am still trying to decide how `C-`, and `M-`, should be thumbed, or fingered (indexed, middled, ringed, pinkied/littled).
* It would be nice if links showed where they went in the mode line, or echo area (or minibuffer, or whatever it is called).
* After Vimserting text; it is habitual to reach for the key to escape…
* Shortcutfoo.com is unusable!
* It would be nice if `info` files didn't loop; `\0`.
* The docs should instruct the user to demand/command "-thing"s from Emacs, instead of requesting/begging "-thing"s; empower the user! #psycho[logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity)
* I hate the use of subtraction in function-names and modifier-keys; under_score snake_case, and divisible factors of `:÷M()`, are optimal.
	* `(M :)` applies the λlisp modus operandi.
* RSI
	* `/(Repetitive|Recursive) Strain Injury/`.
	* Rhomboid Strain Injury; paralysing muscle spasms, thought needed x-rays, but didn't goto doctor/hospital (thought about it though could not physically but would not anyway), and instead just googled it; took a while to think of muscle spasms, since i awoke up, and was paralysed by pain from any movement, including breathing; coughing is the worst as it is uncontrollable; this is the third, and worst, time…
