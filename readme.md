## hmm
* Saints Row is Home Sweet Home!
	* Query:
		* I have started learning Emacs, and have just completed C-h t, where the conclusion says to complain, but not how, nor who ∴ I complain to you; what is the correct way to type in Emacs? Left C- can only be pinkied. Right C- could either be pinkied, ringed, or thumbed. Left, and right, M- could either be middled, indexed, or thumbed. I am assuming you type C-, and M-, on the opposite side of the keyboard from the following key, using both hands; but it may be more productively efficient to use one hand for one hand touch typing, thus enabling the multitasking of two computers, concurrently.
		* Going from Vim to Emacs is like WTF is with bnpf? They are all over the place! (Compared against hjkl in Vim; f is all the way on the other side of the keyboard!).
* I am still trying to decide how <code>C-</code>, and <code>M-</code>, should be thumbed, or fingered (indexed, middled, ringed, pinkied/littled).
* It would be nice if links showed where they went in the mode line, or echo area (or minibuffer, or whatever it is called).
* After Vimserting text; it is habitual to reach for the key to escape…
